# Editor Extentions
 
This package currently provides two functionalities and may be extended in the future. The two functionalities are as follows:

## Enter Play Mode from Start Scene (PlayMainScene)
By using the menu item (Play -> Play Main Scene) or the shortcut (shift + t) the editor changes into the Play Mode. Equivalent to a build version, the start scene of the project is loaded first. If the currently opened scene contains unsaved changes, you will be asked whether you want to save or discard them before entering Play Mode. When leaving the Play Mode, the scene from which the Play Mode was entered is loaded again.

## Restore Game State in Editor (ClearData)
The menu items (Edit -> Clear Data -> *) can be used to clear game saves, game settings, or both inside the editor. This makes it possible to efficiently restore the game to an initial state. In the script you will find correspondingly commented places where you can adapt the script for your memory management (file names and paths).
